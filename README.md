## Introduction

What is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity is the protection of internet-connected systems, including hardware, software and data, from cyberattacks. The purpose of cybersecurity is to help prevent cyberattacks, data breaches and identity theft and can aid in risk management. Cybersecurity is challenged by many aspects of threats:

·Malware, any file or program used to harm a computer user, such as worms, computer viruses, Trojan horses and spyware.

·Ransomware, a subset of malware in which the data on a victim's computer is locked malware

·Social engineering, an attack that relies on human interaction to trick users into breaking security procedures in order to gain sensitive information that is typically protected.

·Phishing, a form of fraud where fraudulent emails are sent that resemble emails from reputable sources; however, the intention of these emails is to steal sensitive data, such as credit card or login information.

What is Apache Shiro?

Apache Shiro is a powerful and flexible open-source security framework that cleanly handles authentication, authorization, enterprise session management and cryptography.

Authentication: Sometimes referred to as ‘login’, this is the act of proving a user is who they say they are. 

Authorization: The process of access control, i.e. determining ‘who’ has access to ‘what’. 

Session Management: Managing user-specific sessions, even in non-web or EJB applications. 

Cryptography: Keeping data secure using cryptographic algorithms while still being easy to use. 

What can you do with Apache Shiro?

Here are some things that you can do with Apache Shiro:

Authenticate a user to verify their identity

Perform access control for a user, such as:

  Determine if a user is assigned a certain security role or not
  
  Determine if a user is permitted to do something or not
  
  Use a Session API in any environment, even without web or EJB containers.
  
  React to events during authentication, access control, or during a session’s lifetime.
  
  Aggregate 1 or more data sources of user security data and present this all as a single composite user ‘view’.
  
  Enable ‘Remember Me’ services for user association without login
  …
  and much more - all integrated into API.


## Pros and Cons:

Pros: flexibility, easy to configure, supports cloud, desktop and mobile platform

Cons:Apache Shiro does not currently deal with Virtual Machine level security. Shiro does not currently natively support ‘multi-stage’ authentication

## Recommendations and Conclusion:

Apache Shiro seems to be a reliable, easy to understand framework to work with. It supports different platforms and works beautifully on different environments. Besides, Apache Shiro is easy to install and configure. However, if you work with VM and want to do cybersecurity protection, other options may be better choice.
